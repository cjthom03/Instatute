### Instatute

[Live Demo](https://udemy-clone.herokuapp.com/)

Instatute is an online learning market where users can subscribe to courses (for free) and view video lessons. Instatute's design is a clone of Udemy and its content comes directly from Khan Academy's YouTube videos.

This project was designed and built under a two-week deadline, although enhancements will be added over time.

## Features

* Secure frontend and backend user authentication using BCrypt
* Users can search for courses and otherwise explore the site before logging in
* Once logged in, users can subscribe to courses and then view lesson videos
* A 'My Courses' page provides direct access to subscribed courses
* Lesson completion is registered at the end of each video, and tracked on the course page
* Users have the option of manually marking lessons complete / incomplete


## Project Design

## Technologies

In addition to the included packages and gems, (AWS S3)[https://aws.amazon.com/s3/] was used for image hosting.

## Possible Future Features
* Allow users to rate courses (1-5 stars)
* Allow users to comment on courses
* Categorize course content and allow filtering by course type
